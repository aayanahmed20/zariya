"""
Lightweight, dependency-free test harness for kb_engine.offline_reply().

Why this exists: the changes in this branch were made by Claude using only
browser automation tools (no Python runtime available), so it could not
literally run this app and fire prompts at it. This script generates several
hundred varied prompts across every category the offline engine handles,
plus a batch of edge cases and a regression check for a bug that was fixed
(see below), runs them all through offline_reply(), and reports anything
that crashes or looks wrong.

Run it yourself with nothing but the standard library, from the webapp/
folder:

    cd webapp
    python test_kb_engine.py

It does NOT need Flask, Ollama, or any API key -- it imports kb_engine.py
directly, exactly like app.py's offline fallback does.

Bug this guards against: try_math() used to fire on ANY text containing
digits plus an operator-like character anywhere in the message, so things
like phone numbers ("call me at 555-1234"), dates, and sports scores
("we won 3-2") were silently misread as arithmetic and given a nonsense
numeric answer. It now only evaluates when the rest of the message is just
normal math phrasing. The "regression" prompts below check this stays fixed.
