"""
Local-model inference via Ollama, server-side.

Why Ollama instead of embedding llama-cpp-python directly: llama-cpp-python
needs a working C++ build toolchain to install on many machines, which fails
silently or loudly depending on the platform. Ollama (https://ollama.com) is
a free, single-installer application -- prebuilt for Windows/Mac/Linux, no
compiler, no account, no API key -- that runs open-source models locally and
exposes them over a small local HTTP API. This module just talks to that API.

Setup, once, on the machine that runs this server:
1. Install Ollama from https://ollama.com/download (a normal app installer).
2. Make sure it's running (it starts automatically after install on most
   platforms; otherwise run the ollama app / 'ollama serve').
3. That's it. On first request, this module asks Ollama to pull a small
   default model automatically if it isn't already present -- no need to run
   any command yourself.

If Ollama isn't installed or isn't running, this module simply reports
itself as unavailable and app.py falls through to the offline knowledge
engine, so the app is never broken by this being absent.

Override the model with LOCAL_MODEL_NAME in .env (any name from
https://ollama.com/library). Override the Ollama address with OLLAMA_URL if
it's running on a different host/port. Set DISABLE_LOCAL_MODEL=1 to skip
trying to use a local model entirely. The active model can also be switched
at runtime from Settings, without touching .env or restarting -- see
set_active_model() below.
